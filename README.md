# hierarchical_clustering_cars

We will be looking at a clustering technique, which is Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering which is a bottom up approach. We will achieve this using Python, Scikit Learn and SciPy.

In this notebook, we will be looking at Agglomerative clustering, which is more popular than Divisive clustering.
